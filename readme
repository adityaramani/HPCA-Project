Open the file script.sh in tsp_openmp or word_count_openmp
Change the directory in the first line of the script.sh to the directory where the HPCA folder is present. 
"bash script.sh" in a terminal to run the codes. 
The outputs will be saved in the output folder in both cases. (In case outputs already present, delete the files in the output folder and run the script again.)
